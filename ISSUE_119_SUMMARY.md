# Issue #119 Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

Retire `GedcomLoader` or align it with the reducer-based hook to avoid dual implementations.

## Analysis

Upon investigation of the current codebase:

1. **No GedcomLoader component found**: The `src/components/GedcomLoader.tsx` file does not exist in the current codebase structure.
2. **No duplicate fetching logic**: The current architecture uses `useGedcomDataWithLLM` in the main App component, with data passed down as props, eliminating duplicate requests.
3. **Inconsistent patterns**: While there was no duplicate fetching, `useGedcomDataWithLLM` was using the old useState pattern instead of the reducer pattern introduced in issue #117.

## Solution Implemented

To align with the spirit of issue #119 (eliminate duplicate implementations and ensure consistency):

### Refactored `useGedcomDataWithLLM` to use reducer pattern:

- **Replaced useState hooks** with a `useReducer` implementation
- **Implemented discriminated union state**: `'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'`
- **Added event-based transitions**: `fetch_started`, `fetch_succeeded`, `fetch_failed`, `refetch`
- **Prevented impossible states** (e.g., loading && error)
- **Maintained API compatibility** with existing consumers

### Key Benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Both `useGedcomData` and `useGedcomDataWithLLM` now use the same state management pattern
2. **Reliability**: Eliminates impossible states through discriminated unions
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized state transitions make the code easier to reason about
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with exhaustive action handling

## Files Modified

- `client/src/hooks/useGedcomDataWithLLM.ts` - Refactored to use reducer pattern

## Status

âœ… **Resolved** - No duplicate fetching logic remains, and all data loading hooks now use consistent state management patterns.
