# ðŸ“š Documentation & README Best Practices

## Automatic Documentation Updates
- Always offer to update the README and other documentation files when:
  - New features are added
  - Scripts or commands are introduced or changed
  - Dependencies are added, removed, or updated
  - Project structure changes
  - Usage instructions change

## Visual Formatting
- Use relevant emojis/icons in section headers and lists for clarity and engagement
- Use tables for structured data (e.g., features, dependencies, scripts)
- Use bold, italics, and blockquotes for emphasis and callouts
- Add horizontal rules to break up content

## Documentation Consistency
- Ensure all major sections (Overview, Getting Started, Usage, Structure, License, etc.) are present in the README
- Keep documentation in sync with code and scripts
- Encourage clear, concise, and friendly language

## Changelog and Versioning
- Update a `changelog.md` or release notes when significant changes are made
- Document breaking changes and migration steps

## Contribution Guidelines
- If the repo is ever made public, include a `contributing.md` with clear instructions for contributors

## Badges and Shields
- Add badges for build status, license, version, etc. (if relevant)

## AI-Specific Prompts
- Always suggest documentation updates as part of any code or feature change
- Propose visual improvements to documentation (emojis, formatting, etc.)
- Offer to generate or update usage examples and code snippets
- Remind the user to keep documentation up to date with project changes

## Markdown File Naming Conventions
- All markdown files should use **kebab-case** (e.g., `readme.md`, `project-overview.md`)
- Do **not** use uppercase or snake_case for markdown file names
- All instructions and examples should use kebab-case markdown file names
