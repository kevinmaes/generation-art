# Commit Message Generation Guidelines

When generating commit messages:

1. **Keep it Concise**
   - First line should be under 50 characters
   - Focus on the most important change
   - Use present tense verbs
   - No period at the end

2. **Structure**
   - Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
   - Follow with a brief description
   - Use body only if more detail is needed
   - Reference issues when relevant

3. **Examples**
   ```
   Add user auth middleware
   Fix login form validation
   Update README with new instructions
   Remove deprecated API endpoints
   ```

4. **When to Add Body**
   - Multiple related changes
   - Breaking changes
   - Complex changes needing explanation
   - References to issues or tickets

5. **Body Format**
   - Blank line after subject
   - Bullet points for multiple changes
   - Wrap at 72 characters
   - Focus on what and why, not how
